# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

-   Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.

-   Stimulates the participant's thinking.

-   Involves the participant in the learning process.

-   Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).

-   Ensures individual participant accountability.

-   Ties it all together for the participant.

-   Provides insight and experience to the learning process.

-   Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.

-   Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.

## Whiteboard design session flow 

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

Outcome: Analyze your customer's needs

-   Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements

-   Current customer infrastructure and architecture

-   Potential issues, objectives and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

Outcome: Prepare to present a solution for your target customer audience

-   Determine your target customer audience

-   Determine customer's business needs to address your solution

-   Design and diagram your solution

-   Prepare to present your solution

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

Outcome: Present solution to your customer

-   Present solution

-   Respond to customer objections

-   Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

-   Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

-   Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide

-   Become familiar with all key points and activities.

-   Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

-   Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

-   Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

-   **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

-   **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

-   **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What is your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

#  Azure security and management whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this session, the customer is looking for managing and monitoring solutions for their Azure IaaS move to the cloud. The student will need to provide solutions for dealing with both the VMs and the Application.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study 

**Outcome** 

Analyze your customer’s needs.
Time frame: 15 minutes 
Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips. 
1.  Meet your table participants and trainer 
2.  Read all of the directions for steps 1–3 in the student guide 
3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study


#### Customer situation

FusionTomo (FT) is a multi-national holding company headquartered in Los Angeles, CA that owns 48 manufacturing companies located in North America, Europe and Asia. These companies sell their products primarily to distributors or large retail organizations around the world. FT, as the parent company, controls the IT systems for the companies that it owns and thus runs their e-commerce based applications. There are about 125 of these e-commerce applications used primarily for business-to-business purchasing by corporate buyers. These apps provide the bulk of FT's 15 billion dollars in revenue per year, so they are mission critical.

FT's CIO Jane Fields said in their last executive briefing, "we need to optimize our architecture and move away from our brick and mortar datacenters, but it must be done in a way where we can retain or even improve our ability to ensure our systems are monitored and secured."

Recently FT has started to investigate what it would take to move from on-premises datacenters to the cloud. Most of their applications are ASP.NET running on Windows VMs with SQL Server in a traditional N-tier configuration. Their goal is a lift and shift of these applications over to the cloud while gaining more control over the applications and improving their security posture.

Per Roberto Milian, VP of Development and IT Operations, "FT's primary concern is how to best: deploy, test, manage, monitor, patch, secure and troubleshoot these applications in Azure IaaS."

Mlian's team is heavily investing in DevOps and already uses PowerShell DSC with their applications. Six of their key Architects have just recently attended an Azure DevOps training class where they learned how to create and leverage ARM Templates. TS wants to have all applications deployed in an "Infrastructure as Code" model, along with being configured and maintained using Azure Automation DSC.

FT is looking for management tools that will allow them to have a full end-to-end view of both the infrastructure's status and application's performance. They do not have time or money to instrument the applications, but they realize that they need a deeper understanding of their applications as they have had performance issues in the past. FT would also like to be able to run ad-hoc performance tests with very limited scripting.

Latisha Downs is the Global Service Management Lead for FT. During discussions with her team, she was very passionate about ensuring Service Continuity. "Of course, there is the need to have constant 'up/down' monitoring of the sites and these tests need to be global in nature. The tool needs to support our ability to create customized alerts that notify the Services Operations Center (SOC) via emails into our trouble-ticket system." Downs also mentioned during that meeting, it was clearly important to provide their service desk personnel with mobile access to the monitoring system. Robert noted, "I want to give them visibility no matter where they are located, and empower them with the current status of the system by pushing alerts to their smartphones."

Having an easily customizable dashboard integrated with the Azure Portal is very important to FT, as they do not want to have multiple "panes of glass" to manage and monitor Azure. An integrated experience will reduce the learning curve, since they are already having to learn the Azure Portal.

Of course, security is on the top of the chain, so they also need a security solution and updated management system. Since FT's business leverages all e-commerce based applications, they need to ensure that only the appropriate level of access to the system is allowed and they need to be alerted if systems are being attacked.


#### Customer needs 

1.  FT wants to continue to embrace their move toward DevOps techniques, as they move to Azure. They want to move to an Infrastructure as Code model for the deployments, and they have automated configuration management for their applications.

2.  FT needs to ensure all diagnostic data for the systems are rolled up together to support their ability to troubleshoot outrages and identify correlations between issues and errors to determine root cause of problems.

3.  FT needs a full infrastructure monitoring and management solution containing the following abilities. It is important that all of the machine data be captured and searchable by their teams. Software Update Management is an area that needs to be addressed, as patches need to be distributed in timely manner. FT needs a tool to determine where they stand if an outbreak or issue occurs. Also, whenever there is a system outage or the problem question comes up "what changed", the solution should be able to provide that type of information to the SOC. Security is a must in the cloud age, so FT needs a great dashboard and set of solutions that can help them understand the current status of their deployment and capture all logs in case of a breach. All of this together needs to allow for the creation of customer alerts FT can build on their own. They want these alerts to be flexible based on real machine data, emails to the trouble-ticket system and notifications sent to smartphones. These notifications should be accompanied by a professional mobile application not just the ability to log into a webpage from a smartphone. Finally, the customer has a huge SQL Server footprint with more than 150 applications relying on the DBMS. The solution should proactively provide feedback about the SQL Servers to help FT to correct known errors that Microsoft should correct on all SQL Servers.

4.  FT is also looking for an Application Monitoring Solution that can provide end-to-end monitoring and visibility of their applications. It needs to allow the team to drill into the data and determine which pieces of the application are not performing well including the dependences such as the SQL Server and any queries that are running in the background. They also need to have a web monitoring solution providing up/down tests from spots all over the globe and the ability to tell them when the application is not performing as expected. Performance testing is something they have lacked for a long time, but they have a good understanding of the applications in their current deployments. FT needs the ability to perform simple performance tests that will help them benchmark and size their VMs without having to run a bunch of code or invest in expensive tools or consultants. One final aspect that is important to FT is the ability to create Application Layer Alerts which need to show up in the portal. Also, the Application Management Solution needs to integrate with the Management and Monitoring solution. This means that all of the data from Application Performance Management (APM) should flow into the other management system.

#### Customer objections 

1.  FT cannot change the code of any application as a part of this deployment, so all application monitoring must be done without instrumenting the code.

2.  They believe Microsoft does their best for securing the Azure network, but they are very unsure how to detect when hackers are attacking their system. How will Microsoft's solution ensure we have visibility into our security posture?

3.  SQL Server is used extensively in their application eco-system. FT is concerned about proper configuration, and they are worried SQL may not perform adequately on VMs in Azure. The system needs to provide feedback on proper configurations with the ability to drill down into how the system is performing, even down to the query level, showing dependences and their ASP.NET applications.

    -   If needed, the trainer may also provide feedback.

## Wrap-up

-   Have the table participants reconvene with the larger session group to hear a SME share the following preferred solution.

##  Preferred target audience

Jane Fields, Chief Information Officer

Roberto Milian, VP of Development and IT Operations

Latisha Downs, Global Service Management Lead

The primary audience are the business and technology decision makers. From the case study scenario, this would include the CIO, VP of Development and IT Operations and the Global Service Management Lead. Working at each level for sponsorship and buy in will be important to the success of the solution.

## Preferred solution

*High-level architecture*

1.  *Without getting into the details (the following sections will address particular details), diagram your initial vision for handling the top-level requirements for deploying, testing, managing, monitoring, patch management compliance, securing and troubleshooting these applications in Azure IaaS. You will refine this diagram as you proceed.*

FT and Microsoft have worked closely along with a partner, to design a solution that meets the needs for migrating the e-commerce applications to Azure. A "Lift & Shift" approach is being proposed.

The design consists of using **Azure Resource Manager**, along with three Microsoft Cloud monitoring and management products: **Azure Security**, **Azure Monitor**, and **Application Insights. **

Azure Resource Manager is the management interface that is used to deploy and manage applications. In the case of FT, they have moved to a DevOps model for the deployment and management of their Infrastructure. Using ARM Templates along with a Source Control solution, provides the ability to automate and deploy their VMs in a repeatable manner without human interaction. Once the template has been tested and deployed to Azure, it will be checked into source control. All subsequent updates to the systems will be made by checking the template out of source control, making changes, testing them thoroughly, then deploying the updated template via automation.

 **Azure Security Center**: Azure Security Center provides a unified view into the security posture of your hybrid cloud workloads, enabling you discover and assess the security of your workloads and to identify and mitigate risk.

 **Azure Monitor:** Azure Monitor provides base-level infrastructure metrics and logs for most services in Microsoft Azure. Azure services that do not yet put their data into Azure Monitor will put it there in the future.

 **App Insights:** Application Insights is an extensible APM service for web developers on multiple platforms. It can be used to monitor the FT live web applications. The data supplied to the Azure Portal is captured either at Runtime and/or by instrumenting an application.

 Each application will be fitted with the Applications Insight Status Monitor which is installed on the IIS servers and captures data at runtime and sends it to the Azure Portal. All the Applications Insights portals will then be connected to Log Analytics via the Applications Insights solution. App Insights has many capabilities that meet the monitoring, alerting, testing and dependency drill through that FT stated are critical for their deployment.

 The combination of these two powerful platforms will provide the visibility to FT's leaders, described as the "end-to-end" view of the e-commerce applications into Azure IaaS.

1.  What services and approach would you take to address the need to continually update their infrastructure and configuration of their applications?

2.  How would changes to the configuration be tracked?

    -  Deployment and control of their applications using Azure Automation DSC and Infrastructure as Code using ARM Templates.

    -  FT will use ARM Templates that will define the infrastructure for each application. When the VMs are provisioning, they will communicate with Azure Automation and use Desired State Configuration to receive the application configurations. This is a fully automated install and configuration management solution leveraging DevOps principles. Deployment can be done via the Portal, Visual Studio, PowerShell or the Azure CLI leveraging a Source Control Platform such as GitHub.

    ![The DevOps - People, Process, Tools diagram has the following steps: Developers, Code Repository, Build, Test, Deploy, FusionTomo App, and Monitor and Improve.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image4.png "DevOps - People, Process, Tools diagram")

3.  How will virtual machine diagnostics data be stored, tracked and made searchable?

    -  Capture VM diagnostics and make them searchable. This activity supports troubleshooting and correlation of issues to determine root cause of problems.

    -  VM diagnostics will be enabled and configured to send logs to Log Analytics capturing the correct events. All this data is indexed as it is ingested for extremely fast searches from the Log Analytics interface. This can be used by the various teams at FT to troubleshoot and correlate issues between multiple machines/systems. It can also be used to create custom alerts (from errors and warnings in the data) to give the team a better understanding of what is happening to specific applications or VMs. The more that the team uses this capability the better they will become at working with machine data.

4.  What approach would you take for patch management and change tracking for their virtual machines?

    -  Infrastructure monitoring and management solution that has the following abilities:

    -  Log Collection, Search and Analytics

    All VMs will be added to the Log Analytics platform, ensuring that log data from every FT system is centralized (one portal experience) and indexed. This will allow for the system to meet the needs of the all FT teams. Log Analytics solutions that are enabled will provide pre-built queries and visualizations to unlock immediate value from this massive amount of log data. Also, ad-hock queries can be performed an easy to learn query language.

    ![A callout in the Log Search blade points to the formula \*Type=SecurityBaseline.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image5.png "Log Search blade")

5.  Patch Management Compliance

    - Ensuring that all the VMs have the correct patch levels is critically important. Using the Update Management automation solution allows for managing the updates for Windows and Linux VMs. The Services Operations Center (SOC) at FT will then have the status of all VMs. There is also the ability to create an "Update Deployment", which will then be a schedule installation of the required updates for the VMs. This creates an Azure Automation Runbook that will kick off the install of the updates. Of course, access to either a WSUS server, or access to Microsoft Update, is required.

    ![Screenshot of the Virtual Machine blade.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image6.png "Virtual Machine blade")

6.  Change Tracking

    -The Change Tracking Solution uses Log Analytics data to identify changes in the environment. The solution will track changes to Windows/Linux Software, Windows Files, Windows Services, and Linux daemons. This allows the technical team to monitor and drill into specific machines to answer the question of, "what changed?", which always comes up during an outage or troubleshooting session for a service that is having issues. The following changes can be viewed: changes by configuration type for software and services, software changes to applications and updates to servers, total number of changes for each application, Linux packages, Windows service change for individual servers and Linux daemon changes.

    ![Log Analytics data displays as previously described.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image7.png "Log Analytics data")

7.  What solution would you recommend for monitoring their infrastructure and respond against breaches? What about their servers still on-premises?

    -  Security Dashboards and Forensics

    -  Azure Security Center provides a unified view into the security posture of your hybrid cloud workloads, enabling you to discover and assess the security of your workloads and to identify and mitigate risk.

    -  Using Azure Security Center will allow FT:

    **Centralized policy management** -- Ensure compliance with company or regulatory security requirements by centrally managing security policies across all hybrid cloud workloads.

    **Continuous security assessment** -- Monitor the security of machines, networks, storage and data services, and applications to discover potential security issues.

    **Actionable recommendations** -- Remediate security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers with prioritized and actionable security recommendations.

    **Advanced cloud defenses** -- Reduce threads with just in time access to management ports and whitelisting to control applications running on VMs.

    **Prioritized alerts and incidents** -- Focus on the most critical threats first with prioritized security alerts and incidents.

    **Integrated security solutions** -- Collect, search, and analyze security data from a variety of sources, included connected partner solutions.

    ![The Azure Security Center desktop displays.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image8.png "Azure Security Center")

7.  Service Map - Service Map automatically discovers application components on Windows and Linux systems and maps the communication between services. It also consolidates data collected by other services and solutions to assist you in analyzing performance and identifying issues.??

    ![Screen capture of a Service Map.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image9.png "Service Map")

8.  How can development, administrators and engineers be notified of alerts and keep tab on their infrastructure?

    -  Custom Alerts that can trigger email notifications and push notifications to mobile devices such as smartphones

    -  At the heart of all solutions and monitoring in Log Analytics is the data that is being sent to the system by the agent running on the Servers. This data can be used to create alerts to inform the SOC of issues happening in real-time or over a period of time. This is accomplished by using a "Saved search" to create an "Alert." These searches can even be scheduled by the team to only run at certain times. Each Alert rule can then have different "Alert Actions", which can include such actions as Email notifications, Webhooks (JSON sent to an API such as Slack or ServiceNOW) or even to kick off a Runbook in Azure Automation to take an action. The Runbooks are great for known error conditions where an engineer knows exactly what do in a specific error condition and can write a script to handle the error condition discovered by the Alert.

9.  Mobile Platform to allow visibility to Developers, Engineers and Administrators

    - Azure has a mobile application which is installable on both iPhone and Android. This allows administrators to be able to have access to a smartphone formatted tool for viewing the dashboard. There is the capability to view or create custom dashboards on the phone. This mobile application also will allow for push notifications to these smart devices, so that alerts will come through as true smartphone notifications.

10. How can FT keep track of the status of their SQL Servers?

    - SQL Server Management capabilities

    - FT using SQL Server extensively, so it is a mission critical platform. FT can use the data in Log Analytics to assess the risk and health of their server environment.

11. What approach would you take for web application monitoring and capturing custom telemetry? How can there be a central view of the state of the applications? What tools are available to test performance from remote geographies?

    Application monitoring solution that has the following abilities:

    - End to End application monitoring and visibility including drill down into dependences

    - Application Insights is a full APM, service for web developers and administrators. It has a full suite of tools that will allow for the successful adoption of the platform for FT. They have stated that they cannot go back and rewire and instrument their code for this portion of the deployment to Azure IaaS. App Insights allows for using the "Status Monitor", on the IIS Servers which sends telemetry data to the Azure Portal. This data provides powerful insights into what is happening across the application including details into the SQL Server calls that it is making. It also allows for creating alerts at the application layer for conditions that would not normally be possible.

14. The telemetry data that is sent to Applications Insights portal can be viewed in many ways: Dashboards (including the Azure Portal), Application Map, Live Metrics Stream, Metrics Explorer for aggregated data, PowerBI and others.

15. Using the Application Insights Connector, all of this data will be available in Log Analytics, meaning that all of the power of this can be acted upon using this data.

16. Up/Down Web tests from all over the world

    Ensuring availability of these e-commerce sites for FT is critical. Web Tests can be setup to monitor both the availability and the responsiveness of the sites. These tests can have origins from all over the world and will sent web request at regular intervals. Then it will alert the SOC if the site does not respond or is performing poorly. There are two types of tests: URL Ping Test and Multi-Step Web Tests. The SOC team can create up to 10 tests for each site.

17. Performance Testing to ensure scalability

    Using the Load Testing feature of Application Insights allows the Engineering teams to create a true load test of the application as deployed in Azure. There is the ability to use either web tests that developers have built or the ability to do a simple Manual test by providing URLs to the portal. These tests can simulate the activity of many thousands of users. During this time, useful data will flow into the Applications Insights portal detailing how the application will perform during load. This load testing capability can also be used to trigger alerts that the SOC has built to ensure that they are working properly (expected actions from Alerts and automatic resolution once issues are resolved).

18. Custom Application Layer Alerts that can trigger email notifications

    App Insights allows the FT team to create performance and usage alerts based on metrics that are being feed to the portal for the web applications. There are three kinds of alerts: Metric Alerts, Web Tests and Proactive Diagnostics. These alerts are based on the telemetry data that is being provided to the portal, so can only be created based on what is flowing into the system. Given that the code will not be instrumented for these applications, Server Response ties and Server exceptions are the most appropriate candidates to use for alerts along with standard items such as average processor time.

19. Application insights also has a feature called Smart Detection. This will proactively look for and raise alerts based on three detection types: Failure Anomalies, Performance Anomalies and Azure Cloud Service Issues (not used in this case).

## Checklist of preferred objection handling

*Deal with each Objection as Stated Above:*

1.  FT cannot change the code of any application as a part of this deployment, so all applications monitoring must be done without instrumenting the code.

    -  Given that Azure Application insights can capture application data at run-time using the Status Monitor, FT will have rich application specific information that they have lacked in the past. This new visibility into their e-commerce implementations is a huge benefit, and a big win for them moving to the platform. This will also work with their existing applications that might remain on-premises as well.

2.  They believe Microsoft adequately secures the Azure platform, but they are unsure how to detect when hackers are attacking their deployments on the Azure platform. How will Microsoft's solution ensure we have visibility into our security posture?

    -  Security Center analyzes the security state of the compute resources, virtual networks, storage and data services, and applications. Continuous assessment helps to discover potential security issues, such as systems with missing security updates or exposed network ports.

## Customer quote (to be read back to the attendees at the end)

"As we jump into Azure, I'm confident that we have the right tools to ensure that our systems will perform as needed and be secure. The best part is the visibility our teams have, end-to-end, from the Applications and SQL, down to the infrastructure."

Roberto Milian, VP of Development & IT Operations, FT
