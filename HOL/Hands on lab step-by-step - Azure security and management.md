# Azure security and management hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives 

The student will deploy and monitor a web application that has been deployed to Azure IaaS in this Hands-on Lab (HOL). Azure security and management services will be used to manage and monitor the operational performance and security of the underlying infrastructure. Azure Application Insights will be used to monitor performance, application usage, and identify the cause of any application issues that emerge.

## Overview

FusionTomo (FT) is a multi-national holding company headquartered in Los Angeles, CA that owns 48 manufacturing companies located in North America, Europe and Asia. These companies sell their products primarily to either distributors or large retail organizations around the world. FT, as the parent company, controls the IT systems for the companies that it owns and thus runs their e-commerce based applications. There are about 125 of these e-commerce applications used primarily for business-to-business purchasing by corporate buyers. These apps provide the bulk of FT's 15 billion dollars in revenue per year, so they are mission critical.

Recently FT has started to investigate what it would take to move from on-premises datacenters to the cloud. Most of their applications are ASP.NET running on Windows VMs with SQL Server in a traditional N-tier configuration. Their goal is to lift and shift these applications over to the cloud while gaining more control over the applications and improving their security posture.

They are looking for you to build out a prototype system in Azure using a sample web application they have provided to you called CloudShop.

They are looking for management tools that will allow them to have a full end-to-end view of both the infrastructure and application performance. Their goal will be to effectively lift and shift all applications over to the cloud. They do not have time or money to instrument the applications. Of course, security is on the top of the chain, so they also need a security solution and updated management system.

Per Roberto Milian, VP of Development and IT Operations - "FT's primary concern is how to best: deploy, test, manage, monitor, patch, secure and troubleshoot these applications in Azure IaaS."

## Solution architecture

## Exercise 1: Configure Azure automation

Duration: 15 minutes

### Overview

In this exercise, you will create and configure an Azure Automation account in the Azure Portal which will be used to configure the application servers using Azure DSC.

### Task 1: Create automation account

1.  Browse to the Azure Portal, and authenticate at <https://portal.azure.com/>

2.  Click **+Create a resource,** and type **Automation** in the search box. Choose **Automation** from the results.\
    ![Fields in the Everything blade are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image21.png "Everything blade")

3.  Click **Create** on the Automation blade. This will display the **Add Automation Account** blade.

4.  On the **Add Automation Account** blade, specify the following information:

    a.  Name: **Automation-Acct**

    b.  Resource group: **HOLRGAUTO** (create a new resource group)

    c.  Location: **Choose the closest Azure region to you**

Note: Some features are only supported in East US 2 so please create your Automation Account in that region.

![Fields in the Add Automation Account blade are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image22.png "Add Automation Account blade")

5.  Click the **Pin to Dashboard,** then click **Create**.

> ![The Create button displays under the selected Pin to dashboard checkbox.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image23.png "Pin to dashboard checkbox")

### Task 2: Add an Azure Automation credential

1.  The CloudShopSQL DSC configuration requires a credential object to access the local administrator account on the virtual machine. Within the Azure Automation DSC configuration click **Credentials** in the **SHARED RESOURCES** section.

    ![Under Shared Resources, Credentials is selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image24.png "Shared Resources section")

2.  Click the **Add a credential** button.

    ![Screenshot of the Add a credential button.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image25.png "Add a credential button")

3.  Specify the following properties and click **Create** to continue.

    a.  Name: **SQLLocalAdmin**

    b.  User Name: **demouser**

    c.  Password & Confirm: **demo\@pass123**

        ![New Credential blade fields are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image26.png "New Credential blade")

Important: It is important to use the exact name for the credential, because one of the scripts you upload in the next step references the name directly.

### Task 3: Upload DSC configurations into automation account

1.  Click **Resource groups \> HOLRG \> Automation-Acct** and click **DSC Configurations**.

> ![Screenshot of the Automation Account blade.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image27.png "Automation Account blade")

2.  Click on the **+ Add a configuration** button.

> ![In the Automation Account blade, the Add a configuration button is selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image28.png "Automation Account blade")

3.  On the **Import** pane, upload both **C:\\HOL\\CloudShopSQL.ps1** and **C:\\HOL\\CloudShopWeb.ps1** files. You'll need to click on **+ Add a configuration** a second time to upload the second file.

    ![Screenshot of the Import blade with fields set to the previously defined settings.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image29.png "Import blade")

4.  After importing the .ps1 files, click the **CloudShopSQL** DSC Configuration. Then, select **Compile** on the toolbar (*click **Yes** on the overwrite prompt*). Do the same for **CloudShopWeb.**

> ![The name field is set to CloudShopSQL in the Automation Account blade.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image30.png "Automation Account blade")

![Screenshot of the Configuration blade.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image31.png "Configuration blade")

![In the Compile DSC Configuration box, the Yes button is selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image32.png "Compile DSC Configuration box")

5.  Make sure to review the DSC configurations to ensure they have completed the compile prior to moving on to the next step.

    ![Screenshot of the Configuration blade.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image33.png "Configuration blade")

### Summary

In this exercise, you configured an Automation account, and configured DSC configuration scripts that will be leveraged by the virtual machine resources.

## Exercise 2: Build CloudShop environment

Duration: 60 minutes

### Overview

In this exercise, you will run a template deployment using an ARM template provided which will deploy a Virtual Network, Azure Load balancer, two IIS Servers and a SQL Server. The Servers will check into Azure Automation and run the DSC Configurations that you built in Exercise 1. This will configure the boxes with the CloudShop Application. You will also configure Inbound NAT Rules to allow RDP access to the Web Servers. Azure diagnostics will also be configured into a new storage account for the VMs.

### Task 1: Template deployment

1.  In the portal, open your Azure Automation Account created earlier.

2.  Under **Account Settings,** locate the and click **Keys.**

    ![Under Account Settings, Keys is selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image34.png "Account Settings section")

3.  Open ***Notepad*** and copy both the **Primary Access Key** and the **URL**. These will be needed inputs for the template deployment.

    ![The copy buttons are selected next to the Primary Access Key and URL.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image35.png "Access keys")

    ![The primary key and URL displays in Notepad.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image36.png "Notepad")

4.  In the Azure Portal, click the **+Create a resource** button. In the Search box, type **Template Deployment.**

    ![The Pin to dashboard checkbox and Purchase button are selected in the Terms and Conditions section.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image42.png "Terms and Conditions section")

12. A Deployment tile will appear on your **My Dashboard**. This deployment should take about 25-30 minutes. The servers will take some time to check in with Azure Automation and configure the CloudShop application.

> ![Screenshot of the Deployment tile.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image43.png "Deployment tile")

NOTE: Wait for the Deployment to successfully complete prior to moving on to the next steps.

13. Now that the servers are built, and the deployment is complete, let's verify the servers are up and running properly.

14. In the Azure Portal, open the **HOLRG,** and locate the Public IP Address **hackathonPublicIP**. Click on the blade to open.

> ![In the Azure Portal, in the Search results list, hackathonPublicIP is selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image44.png "Azure Portal")

15. On the **hackathonPublicIP** blade, locate the DNS Name you provided during the template deployment. If you hover your mouse over the name, you can **click to copy** the name to the clipboard. Paste this into your Notepad document you opened earlier.

    ![The DNS name is selected in the HackathonPublicIP blade.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image45.png "HackathonPublicIP blade")

16. Open a new tab in Internet Explorer and paste the URL. This is the DNS name that is attached to the Azure Load Balancer in front of the CloudShop Application web servers **WEBVM1** & **WEBVM2**.

17. When the page loads, the CloudShop application should appear, and it will show which VM is serving the web page. In this screen capture, we see it is running on **WEBVM2**.

    ![Screenshot of the Cloud Shop webpage with a callout pointing to the WEBVM2 virtual machine name.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image46.png "Cloud Shop webpage")

18. By pressing **F5** on your keyboard, you can refresh the website until you see that **WEBVM1** is also serving webpages.

    ![Screenshot of the Cloud Shop webpage with a callout pointing to the WEBVM1 virtual machine name.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image47.png "Cloud Shop webpage")

### Task 2: Allow remote desktop to the WEBVM1 & WEBVM2 using NAT rules

Now that the deployment and the application is up and running, the next step is to allow RDP to the Web Servers. This will be accomplished by building NAT Rules through the Azure Load Balancer.

1.  Open the **HOLRG** Resource Group and locate **loadBalancer1**. Click to open its administration blade.

    ![In the Resource group blade, under Name, loadBalancer1 is selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image48.png "Resource group blade")

2.  On the **loadBalancer1** blade, locate **Inbound NAT rules,** and click in **Settings**.

    ![In the LoadBalancer 1 blade, under Settings, Inbound NAT rules is selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image49.png "LoadBalancer 1 blade")

3.  Click **+Add,** and complete the blade using the following information:

    i.  Name: **rdp-webvm1**

    <!-- -->

    a.  Frontend IP Address: **accept default**

    b.  Service: **RDP**

    c.  Port: **3389**

    d.  Associated to: **webavset**

    e.  Target: **Choose a virtual machine: WEBVM1**

    f.  Network IP configuration: **ipconfig1 (10.0.0.4)**

In this exercise, you will explore the information and data being provided by Azure Security and Operations Management and Application Insights to gain situational awareness of the application and infrastructure. You will look at the Security posture of the infrastructure, the applications performance, and build a dashboard that can be used to manage it moving forward.

### Task 1: Work with Log Analytics data and Azure Monitor

In this section, we will perform an ad-hoc search in Log Analytics data to see where our servers are not in compliance with security baselines. In the Log Search interface, we can perform ad-hoc searches against the log data being ingested into the Log Analytics service. Because the data is indexed, searching is very fast.

1.  Open the **Azure portal** and navigate to Azure Monitor by clicking **All services**, searching for "*monitor*", and selecting **Monitor**.

> ![Selections in the Azure Portal display as previously mentioned.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image66.png "Azure Portal")

2.  Select **Log Analytics** under **SHARED SERVICES** to navigate to your workspace.

> ![Under Shared Services, Log Analytics is selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image141.png "Shared Services section")

3.  In the search field, enter the following query: *Update \| where OSType!=\"Linux\" and Optional==false*. Click Run. This will search the Update management logs and report results. There are many other data sources we can query.

> ![Screenshot of the Log Search blade.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image142.png "Log Search blade")

Note: you may have less or more data, but keep in mind, the service has only been collecting data since you began the lab.

4.  Notice in the left, there are different types of data. Click **Windows Defender** followed by **Apply**.

    ![Under product, both the Windows Defender checkbox and the Apply button are selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image143.png "Product section")

5.  Notice the query dialog (where you entered a search before) has a search string in it querying for the type "Product==Windows Defender".

    ![An updated search string displays in the Query dialog box.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image144.png "Query dialog box")

6.  As you click on options in Log Search, queries are built automatically. Also, notice the results are paired down to a smaller subset of data. Click on **Table** to view the data in a column and row format.

> ![A Table of search results displays.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image145.png "Table")

7.  This is a list of Windows virtual machines tracked in Update management that have pending updates for Windows Defender. To further refine the list, scroll on the left down to **UPDATESTATE** and select **Needed**. Notice the query automatically updates as it is a single point to refine.

> ![An updated search string displays in the Query dialog box. Below, in the Table, a callout points out that UpdateState for both table entries displays as Needed.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image146.png "Qyery dialog box and Table")

8.  Further refinements can be made as needed. Select additional refiners to update the search.

9.  Next, sort the findings, so the Computers are sorted alphabetically. Click on the column header **Computer** until the virtual machines are sorted correctly.

> ![In the Table, on the header row, Computer is selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image147.png "Table")

10. Now we will export the list. This may be helpful if we wanted to divide the findings list out amongst administrators, so several people can help remediate the findings. Click on **Export**.

    ![On the Log Search blade top menu, Export is selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image148.png "Log Search blade top menu")

    ![The Exporting results to Excel message displays.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image149.png "Exporting results message")

11. Once the report is exported, you are prompted what to do with the file. Click on **Save**. Once completed, click on **Open**. Choose **Notepad** to open the file**.**

> ![The first message asking if you want to save SearchResults.csv has the Save button selected. The second message, download has completed has the Open button selected. The third message asks how you want to open the file, and Notepad is selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image150.png "Multiple messages")

12. Review the text file. Then, close it. You can also copy the file to your local PC and view in Excel.

    ![Screenshot of the .csv information displaying in a Microsoft Excel window.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image151.png "Excel window")

13. Because this is a useful query, we can save it to be able to quickly run it again anytime we wish. First, copy the search query to the clipboard.

    ![Screenshot of a Search query with the Copy option selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image152.png "Search query")

14. Click the **Saved Searches** followed by **+Add.**

    ![Saved Searches is selected from the Log Search blade top menu.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image153.png "Log Search blade top menu")

15. Complete the Add Saved Search Blade with this information:

    a.  Display Name: **Computers Needing Windows Defender Updates**

    b.  Category: **My Queries**

    c.  Query: paste the query from your clipboard

    d.  Function Alias: **WindowsDefNeeded**

        ![Add Saved Search blade fields are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image154.png "Add Saved Search blade")

16. Click **OK.**

### Task 2: Prevention

In this section, we will use the Security Center Overview screen to review what preventative steps we can take to protect our environment.

1.  Within **Security Center** **Overview** page, there are four tiles in the middle of the screen under **Prevention**.

    ![On the Security Center Overview page, under Prevention, four tiles display: Compute, Networking, Storage and data, and Applications.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image155.png "Security Center Overview page Prevention tiles")

    ![Screenshot of the Compute tile.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image156.png "Compute tile")

3.  Notice there are several recommendations at the bottom of the screen. Let's go ahead and drill into these recommendations. Click on the **Remediate security configuration** item.

    ![Screenshot of the Compute page, Overview tab information.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image157.png "Compute page, Overview tab")

4.  This brings up the **Remediate security configurations** panel where we can see there are many configuration items to address. Take some time to explore the items called out in this list. As you click on each item, you'll see more details that allow you better understand the recommendation, the vulnerability, and the potential impact.

    ![Remediate security configurations panel screenshot.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image158.png "Remediate security configurations panel")

    ![On the Configure \'Access this computer from the network\' Remediate security configurations page, security configuration details display.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image159.png "Remediate security configurations page")

5.  Close the panel and navigate back to the **Security Center Overview** page. This time, click on the **Networking** tile to drill into the security health of your networking resources.

> ![Screenshot of the Networking tile.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image160.png "Networking tile")

6.  Based on the details showing in the **Networking Recommendations**, it appears we don't have a Next Generation Firewall installed. We won't implement this recommendation today, but if we wanted to, we could click on the item and implement the recommendation from this panel.

    ![Screenshot of the Security Health Networking page.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image161.png "Security Health Networking page")

7.  Close the panel and navigate back to the **Security Center Overview** screen. This time, click on the **Storage & data** tile.

    ![Storage and data tile screenshot.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image162.png "Storage and data tile")

8.  Notice this tile is green which is an indication the resources are in a healthy state. Azure Security Center will flag the tile as red if there are critical recommendations that need to be addressed.

9.  As a last step, let's navigate back to the **Security Center Overview** screen and click on the **Applications** tile.

    ![Applications tile screenshot.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image163.png "Applications tile")

10. As you review the Applications Security Health, notice there's a recommendation to implement a Web application firewall.

    ![Under Applications recommendation is the message that Web application firewall is not installed.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image164.png "Applications recommendation section")

11. Go ahead and close this panel and return to the **Security Center Overview** page.

12. Azure Security Center provides a quick way to see all the recommendations we just saw in a single view. Click on the **Recommendations** tile under the Overview section.

    ![Screenshot of the Recommendations tile.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image165.png "Recommendations tile")

13. This presents the same recommendations you saw by navigating to each resource type in the previous steps. Clicking the ellipse by each of the recommendations will provide you with additional steps you can take to remediate the recommendation.

    ![The Recommendations page displays a list of recommendations, their resource, state, and severity.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image166.png "Recommendations page")

### Task 3: Set up a manual activity log alert

If one of the virtual machines in the resource group were to be restarted, that's a condition you would want to be notified of. In this section, we will set up a manual alert to detect this condition.

1.  Open the **Azure portal** and navigate to Azure Monitor by clicking **All services**, searching for "*monitor*", and selecting **Monitor**.

> ![The previously mentioned selections are made in the Azure Portal.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image66.png "Azure Portal")

2.  Select **Alerts** under **SHARED SERVICES**.

> ![Under Shared services, Alerts is selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image167.png "Shared services section")

3.  Then, click **Add activity log alert** and fill out the form to match the screen shot below for the **Source**, **Criteria**, and **Alert via** sections. We're creating the alert to notify us anytime a virtual machine in the **HOLRG** is restarted. Note that we are configuring it to notify us via the Azure mobile application which will configure shortly.

![Fields in the Add activity log alert form are set to the previously mentioned settings.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image168.png "Add activity log alert form")

4.  In the Actions section, enter a unique name in the **Action Name** field and select the **Action Type** of **Email/SMS/Push/Voice**. The details blade will open automatically.

> ![Actions section fields are set to the previously defined settings, and the Edit details link is selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image169.png "Actions section")

5.  Selecting the **Email/SMS/Push/Voice** Action Type pops up a panel for entering the recipients email address. This is the same address you will use when you login to the Azure mobile application shortly. This is also the same address you are using to login to your Azure subscription. Click **OK**.

> ![Screenshot of the Email / SMS / Push / Voice blade with the OK button selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image170.png "Email / SMS / Push / Voice blade")

6.  Confirmation messages will display once the action group and the alert rule have been created successfully by clicking **OK**.

> ![Screenshots of the Successfully created alert rule and update action group messages.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image171.png "Successfully created alert rule and update action group messages")

### Task 4: Installing & using the Azure mobile application

In this section, you will take your monitoring solution mobile by installing and configuring the OMS Mobile Application.

1.  Open the **AppStore** or **Google Play** on your mobile device. Locate the search box and type **Microsoft Azure,** and press enter.

2.  When you locate the Microsoft Azure application, install it to your device.

    ![Screenshot of the Microsoft Azure Application Open screen that displays after successfully downloading the application.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image172.png "Azure Application Open screen")

3.  Once the application has been installed, you will need to allow the application to send you notifications.

4.  Next, touch the Sign In Button.

    ![Screenshot of the Sign in screen.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image173.png "Sign in screen")

5.  Once the login page loads, enter your Azure Credentials.

6.  Once you are logged into the app, navigate to the Notifications menu to see there are currently no notifications.

    ![Notifications screen screenshot.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image174.png "Notifications screen")

7.  Putting the phone aside for a moment, in your desktop web browser, navigate to the **HOLRG** resource group list in the Azure portal.

8.  Click on the WEBVM1 that you created earlier. We will restart this virtual machine, which should cause a trigger to the Azure mobile application.

> ![WEBVM1 is selected from the resource group list.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image175.png "Resource group list")

9.  Click the **Restart** button the toolbar to restart the virtual machine.

    ![Restart is selected on the Azure Portal toolbar.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image176.png "Azure Portal toolbar")

10. Click **Yes** to confirm that you want to restart this virtual machine.

11. In a few moments, you will receive an alert through the Azure mobile app that the virtual machine was restarted.

### Task 5: Application Insights

Understanding what is happening within an application can be very challenging, but with the Application Insights configured for CloudShop, there is great telemetry being fed to the Azure Portal. Here, you will investigate that data regarding how the CloudShop is performing.

1.  Open the **Azure portal** and navigate to Azure Monitor by clicking **All services**, searching for "*monitor*", and selecting **Monitor**.

> ![The previously mentioned selections are made in the Azure portal.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image66.png "Azure portal")

2.  Locate the **HOLCloudShop** Applications Insight resource in the **Overview** blade and click **HOLCloudShop.**

> ![Application Insights (1) is selected in the Overview blade, and under Name, HOLCloudShop is selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image177.png "Overview blade")

1.  From the **Overview** blade, click **Pin to Dashboard**.

    ![The Performance Monitoring dashboard displays.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image180.png "Performance Monitoring dashboard")

4.  This dashboard gives near real-time insight into what's happening with your application. In the screenshot below, you can see this application appears to have a performance issue with the Home/Index page. It appears to be taking 20.5 seconds on average to load. NOTE: Your numbers may not match. By clicking on the GET Home/Index, you will see the other sections of the dashboard will filter to performance data focused on that page.

    ![Under Operation Name, Get Home / Index is selected.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image181.png "Operation Name section")

5.  Feel free to experiment with this dashboard to understand the performance considerations of your application.

    ![Screenshot of the Operations dashboard.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image182.png "Operations dashboard")

6.  Pin this dashboard to My Dashboard by clicking on the pin in the top right of the screen.

    ![Screenshot of the Pin icon.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image183.png "Pin icon")

7.  At this point, navigate back to **My Dashboard** and click **Edit Dashboard,** and arrange the many tiles you have added to give yourself an all up view of the environment you have built. Feel free to open the various solutions, find interesting data and Pin it to the Dashboard.

    ![Screenshot of My deashboard.](images/Handsonlabstep-by-step-Azuresecurityandmanagementimages/media/image184.png "My deashboard")
